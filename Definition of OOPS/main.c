Object Oriented Programming: 

1. Object:

	a. Basic run time entity
	b. Exxample: pen, bag, students, etc...
	c. Each object contains properties and operations/methods

2. class:

	a. class is a blue print of an opbject
	b. class is collection of objects of same type 

	Example :
 
		class pen
		{
			properties : color,name,size
			operations : write, draw
		}

3. Inheritance:

	a. Accuring properties of one class from another class.

	Example:

		     Child class accuring properties of parent class Father.

4 Polymorphism :
	
	a. The ability to take more than one form

	Example :

		A boy behave as student in college, customer in shop, passenger in bus, etc..
	
	Types :
	 
	    1. Compile Time Polymorphism    
	    
	        Definition : Matching function call with function definition during compile time itself
	    
	            Example : Method Overloading
	    
	    
	    
	    2. Run time Polymorphism  
	        
	        Definition : Matching function call with function definition during run time itself
            
                Example : Method Overriding

5. Abstraction :


	a. Exposing onnly the essential details to the users ans hiding the details.

	Example :
		ATM Machine


6. Encapsulation :

	a. Wrapping of data and methods into single unit.

	Example  :
		Capsule
